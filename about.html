  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    Our OS Simulator project is an educational platform designed to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of various Operating System Algorithms. Through interactive simulations, our aim is to make learning these complex algorithms accessible and enjoyable for all users.
    With our simulator, users can witness the execution of different OS algorithms in action. Whether it's process scheduling, memory management, file system organization, or any other fundamental OS concept, our platform provides step-by-step visualizations to help users grasp the inner workings of each algorithm.
    Accompanying each simulation, we provide concise and clear descriptions of the algorithms, breaking down their key components and illustrating how they contribute to overall system performance. We strive to make the learning experience intuitive and engaging, ensuring that users can comprehend and apply these algorithms effectively.
    One of our primary goals is to create a user-friendly interface that promotes ease of use. The simulator's intuitive design enables users to navigate through different algorithms effortlessly, allowing them to focus on the learning experience rather than struggling with technicalities.
    By offering this comprehensive platform, our OS Simulator project aims to empower users to enhance their knowledge of operating system concepts and algorithms. We believe that understanding these fundamental principles is essential for anyone seeking to delve into the world of computer systems and software development.
